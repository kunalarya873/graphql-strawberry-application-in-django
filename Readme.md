# GraphQL Strawberry Application in Django

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate GraphQL Strawberry with Django to build a powerful and flexible API. GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, making it ideal for modern web applications.

## Features

- **Type-Safe Schemas**: Define your data models with type safety.
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Clients can query exactly what they need.
- **Django Integration**: Leverage Django's ORM and admin features.
- **Easy Setup**: Quick installation and configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Django 3.0+
- Basic knowledge of GraphQL
